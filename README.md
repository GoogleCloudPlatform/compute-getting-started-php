### Note
Spanner team now recommends customers to use a new client interface for admin operations (which use auto-generated admin clients, instead of hand-written admin clients). While the old API interface will continue to be supported, any new Spanner admin features (launched after Jan 1, 2024) will now only be supported in the new client interface. Code samples for the new API interface have been updated on the [documentation](https://cloud.google.com/spanner/docs/reference/libraries#client-libraries-usage-php), and code samples for old API interface have been archived [here](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/php-docs-samples/tree/main/spanner/src/admin/archived).
