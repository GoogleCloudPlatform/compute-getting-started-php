# A helper command for running WordPress on Google Cloud Platform

This is a small command line tool for downloading and configuring
WordPress for Google Cloud Platform.

## Prerequisites

* Install [Composer][composer]
* Create a new Cloud Project on [Developers Console][dev-console]
* Enable Billing on that project
* [Enable Cloud SQL API][cloud-sql-api-enable]
* Create App Engine default bucket at [App Engine Setting Page][app-engine-setting]
* Install [Google Cloud SDK][gcloud-sdk]

## Project preparation

Configure Google Cloud SDK with your account and the Project.

```
$ gcloud auth login
...
...
$ gcloud config set project YOUR_PROJECT_ID
```

Then configure the App Engine default GCS bucket for later use. The
default App Engine bucket looks like
YOUR_PROJECT_ID.appspot.com. Change the default acl of that bucket as
follows:

```
$ gsutil defacl ch -u AllUsers:R gs://YOUR_PROJECT_ID.appspot.com
```

## Create and configure a Cloud SQL Second Generation instance

In this guide, we use `wp` for various resource names; the instance
name, the database name, and the user name.

You can create a new Cloud SQL Second Generation instance with the
following command:

```
$ gcloud sql instances create wp \
  --activation-policy=ALWAYS \
    --tier=db-n1-standard-1
```

Then change the root password for your instance:

```
$ gcloud sql instances set-root-password wp \
  --password YOUR_INSTANCE_ROOT_PASSWORD # Don't use this password!
```

To access this MySQL instance, we’ll use Cloud SQL Proxy. Please
download an appropriate binary from
[the download page][cloud-sql-proxy-download], make it executable.

If you haven’t created a service account for the project, please
create it on [the Credentials section][credentials-section] in the
Console (Choose a new service account). Download the JSON key file and
save it in a secure place.

Run the proxy by the following command:

```
$ cloud_sql_proxy \
  -dir /tmp/cloudsql \
    -instances=YOUR_PROJECT_ID:us-central1:wp=tcp:3306 \
      -credential_file=PATH_TO_YOUR_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON
```

Now you can access to the Cloud SQL instance with the normal MySQL
client. Please create a new database and a user as follows:

```
$ mysql -h 127.0.0.1 -u root -p
mysql> create database wp;
mysql> create user 'wp'@'%' identified by 'PASSWORD'; // Don't use this password!
mysql> grant all on wp.* to 'wp'@'%';
mysql> exit
Bye
```

In the above example, I created a new database wp and a new user wp.

## How to use

First install the dependencies in this directory as follows:

```
$ composer install
```

If it complains about extensions, please install `phar` and `zip` PHP
extesions and retry.

Then run the helper command.

```
$ php wordpress-helper.php setup
```

The command asks you several questions, please answer them. Then
you'll have a new WordPress project. By default it will create
`my-wordpress-project` in the current directory.

## Run WordPress locally and create a new user

CD into your WordPress project directory and run the following command
to run WordPress locally (be sure to keep the cloud SQL proxy
running):

```
$ cd my-wordpress-project
$ vendor/bin/wp(.bat) server --path=wordpress
```

Then access http://localhost:8080/. Follow the installation steps,
create the admin user and its password. Login to the Dashboard and
update if any of the plugins have update. I’m assuming that the local
network is secure here. If you think differently, maybe you can first
deploy the app (see below), and access the live site immediately, then
create the first username and its password there.

Now it’s ready for the first deployment.

## Deployment

Use the shell script wrapper for deployment as follows:

```
$ sh deploy_wrapper.sh \
  gcloud preview app deploy \
    --promote --stop-previous-version app.yaml cron.yaml
```

Then access your site, use the username and the password you created
locally. The URL is: https://PROJECT_ID.appspot.com/

Go to the Dashboard, and in the Plugins page, activate the GCS media
plugin. Try uploading a media and confirm the image is uploaded to the
GCS bucket.

## Check if the Batcache plugin is working

On the plugin page in the WordPress dashboard, you should see 2
drop-ins are activated; `advanced-cache.php` and `object-cache.php`.

To make sure it’s really working, you can open an incognito window and
visit the site because the cache plugin only serves from cache to
anonymous users. Also you should access the site several times because
the plugin only caches pages which are considered popular. You will
see the following Batcache stats in the HTML source:

```
<!--
    generated 31 seconds ago
    generated in 0.165 seconds
    served from batcache in 0.009 seconds
    expires in 269 seconds
-->
```

## Various workflows

### Install/Update plugins/themes

Because the wp-content directory on the server is read-only, you have
to do this locally. Run WordPress locally and update plugins/themes in
the local Dashboard, then deploy, then activate them in the production
Dashboard. You can also use the `wp-cli` utility as follows:

```
# To update all the plugins
$ vendor/bin/wp plugin update --all --path=wordpress
# To update all the themes
$ vendor/bin/wp theme update --all --path=wordpress
```

### Remove plugins/themes

First Deactivate them in the production Dashboard, then remove them
completely locally. The next deployment will remove those files from
the production environment.

### Update WordPress itself

Most of the case, just download the newest WordPress and overwrite the
existing wordpress directory. It is still possible that the existing
config files are not compatible with the newest WordPress, so please
update the config file manually in that case.

### Update the base image

We sometimes release the security update for
[the php-docker image][php-docker]. Then you’ll have to re-deploy your
WordPress instance to get the security update.

Enjoy your WordPress installation!
